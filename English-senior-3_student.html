	<p><b>崔蘊久（June）</b><br>Welcome to our website!  We are English advanced class C and we are a happy and diligent class.  A most distinguishing feature of our class is that we are always very happy and high during our classroom attendance.  If you pass by Classroom 8 in the afternoon on Wednesday or Friday, you can always hear roars of laughter and that is us.<br>
	   The soul and most important source of the happiness, of course, come from our teacher Mr.Gao, who is a tall handsome “young” man and who is an excellent teacher as well as actor.  Since most of his students are much older than he, he is very polite and considerate to us.  He would come to the classroom to turn on the air-conditioner before we arrive on hot summer days.  And he always takes it for granted that he should make us happy in addition to teaching us English.  Therefore, he would find some interesting topics for us to discuss so we never feel bored during his class.  Most important of all, he is still single and that is always the best chatting topic for us.<br>
	   Then we are very proud to introduce our two class-leaders. Grace is our founding class-leader and had continued to be our class-leader for four years.  The greatest contribution of hers is that she found a great teacher for us.  She is a retired dancing teacher, so she always behaves gracefully.  And she is enthusiastic and passionate.  If you need help or want to talk to someone, just call her and she is willing to do anything for you.  The other great guy is our class-leader this year.  He has been elected class-leader  twice with one voice.  He is very humorous and he can always find some good ideas to make us get together like a happy family.  He would plan a party elaborately on our teacher’s birthday or manage to take us go outing when the weather is agreeable.  From time to time, he invites us to dine and chat together, which often creates a warm feeling and makes our classmates even closer together. It is not surprising that some of our classmates often present with his or her spouse at the luncheon. We are really content to have these two wonderful leaders.<br>
	   Other classmates come from all walks of life: Frank and Alice are amateur gardeners who have just come back from the US, so they speak perfect American English.  They raise thousands of chickens in the back yard, so Alice got a nickname “雞婆”.  West and Mike are both experienced travelers and they can always give you  good advice about where to go and what to eat if you want to go for a trip.  Ellisa is a member of a regulation committee, so we can consult her whenever we have problems concerning law.  Corinna is a cooking teacher, so we have fresh cookies to eat now and then.  Meg is a music teacher, who often attentively arranges entertaining programs for us.  George is good at not only English but also Japanese.  If you want to learn some Japanese, he would be pleased to teach you.  Both June and Joyce are retired teachers.  They can help us with some grammatical problems and they are glad to give a hand in all the activities of our class.  Peter is the oldest member is our class but he is also the most diligent one.  He always comes to class earliest and is never absent.  He was a doctor before and is a good adviser on health problems.  Helen is the youngest member and she is a lovely little sister of us all.  She speaks very fluent English but she is very modest and willing to learn from everyone else, so we love her very much.<br>
	   Now you can see how blessed and blissful we are.  Don’t be jealous!  If you envy us, why not just join us?
